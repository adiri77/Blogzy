            <div class="mt-2 container"><p><h6  style="text-align: center; color:#4169E1"><b>Bangalore, officially Bengaluru, is the capital and largest city of the southern Indian state of Karnataka. Bangalore has a pleasant climate throughout the year, with its parks and green spaces earning it the reputation of India's "Garden City". Its elevation is the highest among India's major cities.

                The city's nucleus was a settlement around a mud fort, built in 1537 by a local chief, Kempe Gowda. The fort was reconstructed of stone in 1761. Bangalore was the headquarters of the British administration from 1831 to 1881, when the raja was restored. However, Britain retained an administrative and military presence in the city until Indian independence in 1947. Bangalore subsequently became the capital of the new state of Mysore and remained the capital during the reorganization of states in 1956; Mysore was renamed Karnataka in 1973.
                
                Prominent buildings include the legislative building Vidhana Soudha (1956) and the High Court building Attara Kacheri (1867), which are situated across from one another. Also of note are the maharaja of Mysore's palace, the Mysore Government Museum (1866), and Tippu Sultan's fort and palace. Notable local scenic spots are the Lalbagh (Lal Bagh) Botanical Garden (laid out in the 18th century), Cubbon Park (a garden with a lake, an aquarium, and a library), Hesaraghatta Lake, and Chamaraja Lake Reservoir. Nandi Hills (Nandigunda), a hill-station summer resort 38 miles (61 km) north, is the site of two temples dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva.

                Bangalore is known as the "Garden City of India" because of its greenery, broad streets, and presence of many public parks, such as Lal Bagh and Cubbon Park. In May 2012, guidebook publisher Lonely Planet ranked Bangalore third among the world's top ten cities to visit.
                
                The official language of Bangalore is Kannada, spoken by 42.05% of the population. The second-largest language is Tamil, spoken by 16.34% of the population. 13.73% speak Telugu, 13.00% Urdu, 4.64% Hindi, 3.16% Malayalam and 2.05% have Marathi as their first language. The major communities of Bangalore who share a long history in the city, other than the Kannadigas, are the Telugus and Tamilians, who both migrated to Bangalore in search of a better livelihood
                
                The city is widely regarded as the "Silicon Valley of India", as the largest IT hub of the continent. Infosys, Wipro, Mindtree, Mphasis, Flipkart, Myntra are headquartered in Bangalore. Information technology companies located in the city contributed 33% of India's ₹1,442 billion (US$20 billion) IT exports in 2006–07

                <h5><b style="color: black;">Art and Literature</b></h5>
                Compared to Delhi and Mumbai, Bangalore lacked a contemporary art scene until the 1990s, when several art galleries emerged, including the government-established National Gallery of Modern Art. Bangalore's international art festival, Art Bangalore, was established in 2010.

                Kannada literature flourished in Bangalore even before Kempe Gowda laid the city's foundations. During the 18th and 19th centuries, Kannada literature was enriched by the Vachanas (a form of rhythmic writing) composed by the heads of the Veerashaiva Mathas (monastery) in Bangalore. The headquarters of the Kannada Sahitya Parishat, a nonprofit organisation that promotes the Kannada language, is located in Bangalore. The city has its own literary festival, known as the "Bangalore Literature Festival", inaugurated in 2012.

                The Bangalore Literature Festival fêtes reading and writing. Bookworms and bibliophiles are invited to bask in the winter sun in the Garden City of India and meet writers from everywhere — local, national and international — as this festival brings the world to ‘Namma Bengaluru’. The Festival celebrates the creative spirit and commemorates the literary diversity Bengaluru offers, bringing it in conversation with the best minds in the world of literature within and outside India.
                <br><br><h5><b style="color: black;">Theatre, Music and Dance</b></h5>
                
                Bangalore is home to the Kannada film industry, which produces about 200 Kannada feature films each year. Bangalore also has an active theatre culture; popular theatres include Ravindra Kalakshetra and the Ranga Shankara. The city has an active English- and foreign-language theatre scene; popular theatres include Ranga Shankara and Chowdiah Memorial Hall. Kannada theatre is popular in Bangalore and consists mostly of political satire and light comedy. Plays are organised mostly by community organisations, but some by amateur groups. Drama companies touring India under the auspices of the British Council and Max Müller Bhavan also stage performances in the city frequently. The Alliance Française de Bangalore also hosts numerous plays throughout the year.
                
                Bangalore is also a major centre of Indian classical music and dance.[247] The cultural scene features a diverse set of music concerts, dance performances and plays. Performances of Carnatic (South Indian) and Hindustani (North Indian) classical music, and dance forms like Bharat Natyam, Kuchipudi, Kathakali, Kathak, and Odissi are very popular.
            
                Yakshagana, a theatre art indigenous to coastal Karnataka is often played in town halls. The two main music seasons in Bangalore are April–May during the Ram Navami festival, and September–October during the Dusshera festival, when music activities by cultural organisations are at their peak.

                Though both classical and contemporary music are played in Bangalore, rock music dominates the music of urban Bangalore; Bangalore has its own subgenre of rock, "Bangalore Rock", an amalgamation of classic rock, hard rock and heavy metal, and some jazz and blues.
