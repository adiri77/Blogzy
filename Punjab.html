            <div class="mt-2 container"><p><h6  style="text-align: center; color:#4169E1"><b>Punjab is a state in northern India. Forming part of the larger Punjab region of the Indian subcontinent, the state is bordered by the Indian states of Himachal Pradesh to the north and northeast, Haryana to the south and southeast, and Rajasthan to the southwest; by the Indian union territories of Chandigarh to the east and Jammu and Kashmir to the north. It shares an international border with Punjab, a province of Pakistan to the west
                
            The history of Punjab has witnessed the migration and settlement of different tribes of people with different cultures and ideas, forming a melting pot of Punjabi civilisation. The Indus Valley civilization flourished in antiquity before recorded history until their decline around 1900 BCE. Punjab was enriched during the height of the Vedic period, but declined in predominance with the rise of the Mahajanapadas.The Punjab region is noted as the site of one of the earliest urban societies, the Indus Valley Civilization that flourished from about 3000 B.C. and declined rapidly 1,000 years later, following the Indo-Aryan migrations that overran the region in waves between 1500 and 500 B.C.
                
            The Mughals came to power in the early sixteenth century and gradually expanded to control all of the Punjab from their capital at Lahore. As Mughal power weakened, Afghan rulers took control of the region. Contested by Marathas and Afghans, the region was the center of the growing influence of the Sikhs, who expanded and established the Sikh empire in 1799 as the Mughals and Afghans weakened. The Punjab was annexed by the East India Company in 1849. Although nominally part of the Bengal Presidency it was administratively independent. During the Indian Rebellion of 1857, apart from Revolt led by Ahmed Khan Kharal and Murree rebellion of 1857, the Punjab remained relatively peaceful.[79] In 1858, under the terms of the Queen's Proclamation issued by Queen Victoria, the Punjab came under the direct rule of Britain. During the colonial era, the various districts and princely states that made up Punjab Province were religiously eclectic, each containing significant populations of Punjabi Muslims, Punjabi Hindus, Punjabi Sikhs, Punjabi Christians, along with other ethnic and religious minorities. However, a major consequence of independence and the partition of Punjab Province in 1947 was the sudden shift towards religious homogeneity occurred in all districts across province and region owing to the new international border that cut through the subdivision.

            In 1919 a British officer ordered his troops to fire on a crowd of demonstrators, mostly Sikhs in Amritsar. The Jallianwala massacre fueled the indian independence movement. Nationalists declared the independence of India from Lahore in 1930 but were quickly suppressed. The struggle for Indian independence witnessed competing and conflicting interests in the Punjab. When the Second World War broke out, nationalism in British India had already divided into religious movements.

            During the 1960s, Punjab was known for its prosperity within India, largely due to its fertile lands and industrious inhabitants. However, a significant portion of the Sikh community felt a sense of disparity from the central government of India. The roots of such grievances stretched back several decades, with the primary issue revolving around the distribution of water from the trio of rivers — Ravi, Beas, and Sutlej — that flowed across the Punjabi territory.

                <h5><b style="color: black;">Culture</b></h5>
                Punjab has one of the oldest and richest cultures of the world. Its diversity and uniqueness is evident in the Punjabi poetry, philosophy, spirituality, education, artistry, music, cuisine, science, technology, military warfare, architecture, traditions, values and history. The compassion and high spiritedness exhibited in the lifestyle of people of Punjab (Punjabis) is hard to miss. While the Punjabis are known for their strong determination, their culture presents a multi-hued heritage of ancient civilizations. A guest in Punjab is considered as a representative sent by God and is well looked after.

                Punjabis celebrate numerous religious and seasonal festivals, such as Dussehra, Diwali, Baisakhi, and many more. There are numerous anniversary celebrations as well in honour of the Gurus (the 10 religious leaders of Sikhism) and various saints. Expressing happiness and gaiety through dance is a typical feature of such festivities, with bhangra, jhumar, and sammi being among the most popular genres. Giddha, a native Punjabi tradition, is a humorous song-and-dance genre performed by women. In addition to Sikh religious music, semi-classical Mughal forms, such as the khyal dance and the thumri, ghazal, and qawwali vocal performance genres, continue to be popular.
                
                Poetry offers one of the clearest views into the Punjabi mindset. Punjabi Poetry is renowned for its deep meaning, beautiful, exciting and hopeful use of words. Many compilations of Punjabi poetry and literature are being translated throughout the world into many languages. One of the most important Punjabi literatures is that of the revered ‘Guru Granth Sahib’.
                
                The traditional dress for Punjabi men is ‘Punjabi Kurta’ and ‘Tehmat’, especially the popular Muktsari style, which is being replaced by the kurta and pajama in the modern day Punjab. The traditional dress for women is the Punjabi Salwar Suit which replaced the traditional Punjabi Ghagra. The Patiala salwar is also very popular.

                <br><br><h5><b style="color: black;">Cuisine</b></h5>
                
                Punjab’s geographical location with relation to the rest of the Sub-continent has meant that this region has had strong Central Asian influences both in its culture and its food. Punjabi cuisine has become world-leader in the field; so much so that many entrepreneurs who invested in the sector have built large personal fortunes due to its popularity. “Sarso ka saag” and “Makki di roti” are examples of well-known and very famous dishes.

                Punjab’s economy has predominantly been agrarian in nature, historically evidenced in the remains of granaries and other artifacts of the Indus Valley Civilization. Dairy products, unleavened flat breads, pulses, vegetable and meat curries continue to reflect the rural temper of the state while being wedded to the residual flavors of foreign invasions, such as rice and gravies. As a result, Punjabi cuisine is among the richest in the country as well as the world. It incorporates generous quantities of milk, curd, butter, and cream in cooking of fresh vegetables and meats. In addition to these, Punjabis have created a combination of the northwest frontier cuisine and Mughlai recipes to prepare rich poultry and mutton dishes. The ubiquitous ‘tandoori chicken’ is very popular.
                
                A word of caution is necessary for first time visitors though, low-fat Punjabi meals are unimaginable and cut no ice with the proud and generous people of Punjab. Their legendary warmth and hospitality assures that anyone who passes through this land will return well fed. In deed, the tradition of langar (community kitchen) initiated by Guru Amardas, came from the belief that food is central to communal bonding. It has since been a remarkable feature of all Gurudwaras, wherein devotees of all faiths participate in the preparation and service of meals.
