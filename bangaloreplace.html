Major General Richard Sankey (Chief Engineer of the State) conceived this park in honour of Sri John Meade. Initially, the park was called "Meade's Park" and later came to be known as the Cubbon Park. Since the introduction of the park, it was made and improved in many ways.

                A visit to the palace gives you a chance to witness the elegant and lavish splendour of one of the most powerful dynasties of South India. An audio tape is available inside the Palace, both in Hindi and English, to help the people having language issues, understand its history better.

Although not fit for swimming, boating can be enjoyed at the lake.<span class="dots">...</span><span class="more"> One of the largest lakes in Bangalore, the Ulsoor Lake is sprawled over an area of 50 hectares. Ulsoor lake was built by Sir Lewin Bentham Bowring, who was Bangalore's commissioner at that time. Sit back or walk in the periphery of the park or click a few shots of the endemic birds that call this destination their home. One of the most popular activities in Ulsoor Lake is boating.Ulsoor Lake is also an important venue for the celebrations of Ganesh Chaturthi, sometime during August and September every year.

                Interestingly, the Ulsoor Lake has an interesting historical legend associated with its name. It is believed that the area in which the present day lake is situated was once covered in a thicket of forests. One fine day, Kempe Gowda, a ruler of the Vijayanagar Empire, was travelling through the place and was rendered exhausted.

                He decided to take shelter under a tree, which turned out to be the same tree under which Mandava Rishi worshipped God Someswara. The Lord appeared to him in a dream and told him about a hidden treasure. When Kempe Gowda woke up from his slumber, he dug up the treasure and using the riched he built the Someswara Pagoda. Ulsoor Lake was created by him in the process.

                A popular local legend says that the Ulsoor Lake was created by King Kempe Gowda sometime in the second century. In those days, the lake was known as the 'Halsur' or 'Alasur' lake. However, the present day lake was created by Sir Lewin Bentham Bowring, the then Commissioner of Bangalore during his period of service. A number of restoration efforts have been made to recreate the former beauty of this destination. 

                Some of these include aeration of wastewater that is lead into the lake, improvement of park and swimming pool , desilting of the lake bed, installation of silt traps at the mouth of the stormwater inlets, diversion of underground sewage lines from the eastern part of the city.

              <p class="card-text" id="para10">Innovative Film City is an Indian movie theme park, popular for a day trip. It houses amusement park rides, museums, adventure sports among other things.<span class="dots">...</span><span class="more">

                The Innovative Film City in Bengaluru is an Indian movie theme park located at Bidadi, just 40 kilometres on the outskirts of the city towards Mysore. One of the most popular tourist attractions in Bangalore, the place covers almost 58 acres of land of fun-filled experiences. Whether you like to shop, eat, simply walk and explore or experience your childhood again; there is something unique that Film City has to offer you.

                The Innovative Film City is broadly divided into three parts and is large enough for you to spend at least half of your day here- to walk around and enjoy all that the city has to offer. Step into the Innovative Attractions to enjoy amusement park rides and museums and enjoy the countless sections, such as Wild West Wind and Cartoon City; and the Innovative Studio to witness the world of movies and glamour. Visit the Innovative Style in between to enjoy shopping and gorge on cuisines from all around the world. A high-quality amalgamation of different themes, the Innovative Film City beckon to both: kids as well as grownups. So make sure that you visit this attraction with your family or friends when you visit Bangalore.

                Cartoon City is a hot favourite amongst kids. Its flamboyance and vibrant theme are especially appealing for them, but they manage to charm adults too. The fun rides from a variety of famous cartoon characters as well as the iconic series of star wars recreate the childhood magic beautifully and make you never want to leave.

                The Aqua Kingdom is a great place to spend some quality time with friends and family, or indulge in a little romance, in the wave pool and the sandy beach. The water slides, children's play area and dance floor with an in-house DJ are a wonderful retreat from the daily humdrum life.

                There is no haunted house like this in Bangalore. Filled up with over 250 props including scary skeletons, horrifying zombies and half-bearded men; this dirty and dingy mansion will give you chills.
