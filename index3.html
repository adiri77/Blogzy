              <h5 class="card-title">Humayun's Tomb</h5>
              <p class="card-text" id="para2">Maqbera e Humayun or the Humayun’s Tomb in Delhi is a major historical site in India and also one of the best places to visit in north Delhi.<span class="dots">...</span><span class="more">It is the tomb of the famous Mughal emperor of India Humayun. It was commissioned by the first wife of Humayun who was the chief consort as well, Empress Bega Begum in 1569-70. The design of the tomb was born in the heart of Mirak Mirza Ghiyas- a persial architect invited by Bega Begum herself. Located in Nizamuddin East in Delhi, the tomb is known as the first garden tomb found on the Indian subcontinent, placed very close to the Dina-panah citadel. It is known to be one of the best places to visit in Delhi during summers as it also has a walled garden within its enclosure.

                UNESCO declared it as a World Heritage Site in 1993 and since then its reputation began to flourish. But after that, it had to undergo several restorations. Near the tomb, there are several smaller monuments from the main entrance to the West that include one that even built prior to the main tomb. Isa Khan Niyazi’s tomb is that one who was an Afghan noble in Sher Shah Suri’s court of the Suri dynasty. Humayun’s tomb complex accommodates the main tomb of the Emperor Humayun along with the graves of Bega Begum, Hamida Begum and Dara Shikoh as well as other significant Mughal members.
                
                An inimitable leap in Mughal architecture is displayed along with the Persian model garden that is the Charbagh garden. The construction of the toms was started in 1565, almost nine years after his death. The completion of the tomb was in 1572. The memorial built for Humayun symbolizes the unpredictable symbiosis between Humayun and his wife Bega Begum who was so grieved over the death of her husband finally decided to create such an astonishing remembrance.
                
                The Turkic and Mughal rule in the subcontinent introduced the influence of Central Asian and Persian styles of Islamic architecture and from the 12th century onward, those styles started inspiring several monuments in and around Delhi. Humayun’s tomb is made of red sandstone and white marbles and the measurements say it is 47 meters high and 91 meters wide.

                Red Fort architecture is an amusing one with a huge walled citadel that shines in red sandstone and the construction of the fort took almost one decade to complete and it came into the limelight in 1648. For the next 200 years, it was maintained as the seat of the Mughal Empire. Once the capital of the Mughal Empire, the fort lies along the famous river Yamuna. Some of the facts regarding the fort say the complex consist of Shah Jahan’s palace as well as the Salimgarh fort which came into existence in 1546 AD.
                
                The fort is managed by the Archeological Survey of India and was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2007.

After Sher Shah Suri defeated Humayun, he named the fort Shergarh and added more structures to the complex. The fort and its surroundings were enhanced to be known as the sixth city of Delhi.
