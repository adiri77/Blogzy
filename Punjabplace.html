Earlier used as Le Corbusier's base, this UNESCO World Heritage Site has now been converted into a museum, and tourists are free to visit it. The Capitol is also home to the state's Vidhan Sabha, High Court, and Secretariat.

              The city of Anandpur Sahib is most famous for its multitude of Gurudwaras that were built to commemorate various Sikh Gurus. There are five forts around the town that testify to the city's military history.

Due to a large number of visitors, the city is very tourist friendly and is well connected to other major cities in the region.

              Anandpur Sahib was founded in 1665 by the ninth Sikh Guru, Guru Tegh Bahadur. Since then, many of his successors have been involved in developing this town as a safe settlement zone for this community.

              When the town was finally inhabited, it had to be protected from the invaders in the West and North. For strategic purposes, many forts were built around the city. The five forts around the town were built by the 10th Guru, Guru Gobind Singh.

              All of these forts are standing today and are visited by thousands of tourists every year. Qila Anandgarh Sahib is the main fort, being the reason why the city was named Anandpur Sahib. It served as the residence of the then army. Qila Lohgarh Sahib is another important fort where weapons for the army were made.

              Constructed in 1952, the wetland actually came to exist when a barrage was built at the confluence of rivers Beas and Sutlej. Boasting of a rich biodiversity, the park is considered a haven for birdwatchers as the wetland is home to a large number of exotic and endangered migratory birds who come here during the winter season. Till date, around 375 species of birds have been recorded here. Among the most popular wildlife include birds like crested pochard, common pochard and tufted duck, reptilian fauna like Indus river dolphin, smooth-coated otter and seven species of rare freshwater turtles, and mammals like Indian otter, the jungle cat, jackal, Indian wild boar and the common mongoose etc. The wetland was declared a sanctuary in 1982 and also a Ramsar site by the International Body of Wetlands under the UNDP in 1990. You are expected to take prior permission from forest officials for entry.

              Located midway between Ludhiana and Ambala, Sirhind is one of the holiest cities for Sikhs in the world. It also has a rich history and a cultural tradition of inclusion and diversity. Most people believe that the name Sirhind comes from 'Sar-i hind', meaning the Frontier of Hind, as Mughal invaders saw it as the 'gateway to Hindustan'. The rulers of this area reportedly fought bravely against invaders, and the many forts and bastions in the city are proof of the military and strategic importance of this city. Today, Sirhind is a very important tourist destination in Punjab and has many forts, museums, Gurudwaras and gardens that each have a fascinating history.

              Sirhind is one of those towns which has managed to preserve its culture and yet caters very well to all including foreign tourists. This makes it a favourite destination for foodies since the food here is authentic and cheaper than major cities like Amritsar and Chandigarh. Most of the hotels and restaurants buy and cook fresh food using local chefs.  There is not a lot of choice in terms of food unless you visit one of the luxury hotels and most local restaurants provide tasty local food.

The city is estimated to be one of the most ancient ones, having been established in the 1st century AD. Gurudwara Ber Sahib is the biggest Gurudwara located in Sultanpur Lodhi and is situated on the banks of the streamlet Kali Bein. It is located near a ‘ber’ tree, which is known to have been where Guru Ji meditated every day for 14 years, 9 months and 13 years. He used to take a bath in the River Bein and then sit under the tree to meditate, and during one such meditation, it is believed he had a communion directly with the Divine. As per the Janam Sakhis, he saw a peculiar light and followed it into the stream. People thought that he had drowned as no one could find him and he had disappeared in the stream for 2/3 days. He reappeared at a spot 2 kms away, which is now called Sant Ghat, and he said, “No one is Hindu, no one is Musalman. We are all human beings.”

              People gathered around him to listen to him, the Qazi of the town, who was a learned man amongst the Muslims, asked Guru Ji to offer Namaz with him in the mosque if Guru Ji truly believed that there was no Hindu or Muslim, and Guru Ji agreed. While everyone was praying, Guru Ji stood there watching. Upon being asked as to why he did not participate in offering Namaz, he said the Qazi was himself pre-occupied with thoughts of the birth of his new born colt who may fall into the well, so who was he to pray with? This made people believe in Guru Ji being a Divine being and a messenger of God himself as he could read people’s innermost thoughts.
