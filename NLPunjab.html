                    And, now even four years later, S Lounge, a resto-lounge (from the stable of Swagath Group of Restaurants) retains its early charm. It still boasts of a steady steam of regulars who swear by its blend of house, hip hop and Bollywood music. And, they also often have celebrity guest DJs and percussionists playing here.

                    The vibe inside is laid-back and friendly and since only couple entries are permitted, you can expect to see the towns kohllined divas with their dates scattered around the centrally placed DJ console. The menu at S Lounge has influences of Swagaths popular coastal and Mughlai fare.

                    The coastal dishes like Butter Pepper Garlic Crab, Tawa Fish and Veg Schezwan Platter are worth a try at this happening restro-lounge. For those who like mixed drinks, they have a seriously good cocktail menu. Bahama Mama made with chunks of tropical fruits added to dark rum and Malibu or Mud Slide, a chocolaty cocktail with vanilla ice cream blended in vodka, Kahlua and Baileys are worth a try.

It transforms into lounge at night.<span class="dots">...</span><span class="more"> The yellow graffitti-laden walls at Caf oz and Bar take you through a colourful map of Australia and the image of a larger than life surfer. The in-house DJ plays house, trance, rock, pop and sometimes even metal. With ice cold beer on tap, Caf Oz and Bar is the go-to place for Chandigarhs youngsters.

                    It provides a refreshing change to the trend of electronica elsewherethe kind of place where you would like to go with friends to enjoy a couple of drinks while watching a football match. The huge screen next to the bar is quite a crowd puller during cricket or football matches.
                    
                    Cafe oz and Bar on weekends sees a full house; even the space around the bar turns into a dance floor. They organize a couple of themed nights like Ladies night and Jazz night which happen every now and then. Though an Australian theme bar, the food here is multi-cuisine and a bit of a dampener. We suggest you stick to the Indian dishes. However, their coffee is something you ought to tryperfectly brewed and sprinkled with chocolate, that is served with delicious homemade butter cookies.

The multilevel layout in this resto-lounge allows for large numbers of clubbers to pack in during the busy nights. Mostly happening on Saturdays and Wednesdays, electronica and Bollywood numbers are primarily the music of choice, with people in glittery outfits and fluorescent eye makeup scattered around the place.

                    DJs Sassy Pandez, Motiv8, Rich Bitch and Midival Punditz have flown in to perform here. Well known bands like Menwhopause and Jalebee Cartels DJ Ashvin have played here too. And if youre lucky, you might spot Bollywood stars like Salman Khan, Karina Kaif, Farhan Akhtar, Abhay Deol, Kalki Koechlin, who stop by for a drink when in this happening town.
                    
                    However, if boogeying the night away isnt really your style, head to the upper level where youll find comfy couches to lounge on. If a little peckish, check out their world cuisine menu. You can also look out for their in-house specialtiesLal Mirch ka Tandoori Jhinga (roasted prawns) and Fattoush salad (Levantine bread salad).

                    The ornate bar with its stainless steel finish is quite an eye catcher. We liked Black Magic (Blavod black vodka, grenadine and 7-up) and Apple Jack (a mix of brandy, grenadine syrup and lemon juice) from the cocktail list. While the French Loop night on Mondays features live streaming of international music, Tuesdays are Fusedays, focusing on laidback lounge music, Wednesdays reserved for Hip Hop and Funky House and Thursdays are reserved for Rock. Sundays are reserved for Retro. Saturdays, however, are club nights featuring commercial hits. The lineups tend to be happening: DJs Nasha, Lil B, Bhavini Shah and Tinu Arora were recently roped in to spin here.

                  <p class="card-text">Peddlers is an old English pub in town where you can walk in wearing shorts and a T-shirt, and no one will give you the stink-eye. The floors and furniture here are all made of dark teak wood <span class="dots">...</span><span class="more"> and the walls are decorated with posters of old British comedies like Carry On and Monty Pythons. As you enter, the thumping music immediately squashes all hopes of conversation (even your pick-up lines may not be heard), but its certainly a good bet if you want to enjoy the music and dance the night away.

                    Peddlers is buzzing on all seven days of the week. When in this pub, you should grab a pint from the bar and dance to songs by Maroon 5, Flo Rida, Pitbull, Jlo and more. The bar snacks like Buffalo Chicken Wings and beer battered fish which are good accompaniments with your drinks are also served here.
                    
                    What makes this pub different from others is what they call WTF! Its not what youre thinking; it stands for Wednesday-Karaoke Night, Thursday-open mike, where anyone from a bathroom singer to a stand up comedian can perform, and Friday-open jam day where seven to eight artists come and play off against each other. Moreover, at Peddlers its happy hours every hour! Any drink you order is a one plus one.

The lift opens into an array of colourful lights across mirrors on the walls which makes it a little difficult to find the entrance to the lounge.

                    Clue: walk towards the left corner and an automatic door will let you in. Though, the lounge has a casual but effortlessly sexy vibe. The music usually veers towards progressive house, pop and Bollywood. Expect a techno-savvy atmosphere, each table has a PDA menuscroll through and punch in what you want to order. The delicious kebabs at Bar 148 are a must try and you will not be disappointed. Patiala pegs are the obvious choices, and to further this stereotype, the cocktails here are twice as strong as you would find at another bar.
                    
                    We advise lightweights to stick to beer. The area in front of the bar turns into a dance floor at night. They have also found a way to keep the neighbourhood aunties happytheir Ladies evenings (every evening 4-8pm)with unlimited snacks and cocktails, has made it the hippest place to have a bite and exchange some gossip.</span> </p>
