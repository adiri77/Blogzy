              <p class="card-text" id="para1">Robber's Cave, locally known as Gucchu Pani, is a river cave formed in the Himalayas. This river cave is believed to be an abode of Lord Shiva. <span class="dots">...</span><span class="more"> Its speciality is that river water flows out from the middle of the cave.

              The cave is a narrow gorge formed between a conglomerate limestone formation. It creates a feeling similar to being in a scene from a mystery movie - surrounded by dark limestone as streams gush in, echoing inside the cave. If not this, it definitely promises a sense of belongingness as Mother Nature slows you down, making you resonate with its mesmerising beauty.
              
              With extraordinary cold water underground springs, the cave cools down during the scorching-hot summer-afternoon. It is a perfect picnic spot amidst the natural beauty of Uttarakhand and must be visited at least once.
               
              Robber's Cave is a fabulous location to have a picnic with friends and family. After a walk inside the 600-metre long cave to explore the region from the inside with your loved ones, you may walk to the waterfall near the cave for a picnic. You can enter the waterfall and capture memorable moments for life. What fun it is to chit-chat about everything under the sun with your loved ones as you rest or grab a bite near the splendid water body. If you are lucky, you might see a beautiful rainbow in the sky over the falls.

              <p class="card-text" id="para2">Sahastradhara meaning 'thousand fold spring' is popular for its ecstatic beauty and therapeutic value since its water contains Sulphur. <span class="dots">...</span><span class="more">

              Its picturesque beauty attracts a lot of travellers. Sahastradhara is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Uttarakhand and is situated about 14 km from the city of Dehradun, near Robber's Cave.

              Also known as Sulphur Springs, this waterfall cascades through limestone stalactites, making the water rich in sulphur. A dip in the Sulphur-rich water here feels cold and refreshing but is believed to have remarkable medicinal advantages. The temperature of the water here is a little lower than its surroundings. Its picturesque beauty attracts a lot of travellers from faraway places. One can even enjoy a stunning view of the mountains on a fun ropeway ride.
              
              The area has widespread serenity and tranquillity, with rich Himalayan vegetation. The water here has a fall of around 9 meters. Since this region has a sedimentary accumulation of Lime and Sulphur, one can spot a plethora of brownish-orange elements in the surrounding caves.

              Although Sahastradhara can be visited throughout the year; the primary season is from September to March. During these months, the water has its natural flow, and the area is flocked by many travellers. To enjoy the best view of the waterfall, travellers are advised to visit Sahastradhara during the rainy season and post-monsoon months.

              <p class="card-text" id="para3">The Tapkeshwar Temple, also known as the Tapkeshwar Mahadev Temple, is located at a distance of 6.5 kilometres from the city centre of Dehradun.<span class="dots">...</span><span class="more"> A humble cave shrine dedicated to Lord Shiva, this revered temple is situated along the banks of a river which imparts it a unique sanctity.  This cave was once the abode of the famous guru Dronacharya and hence is also known as Drona cave.

                A Shiva Linga is enshrined in the main complex which is believed to grant the wishes of all those who seek the Lord's blessings. Water trickles from the ceiling continuously on the Shivalinga, making it an interesting spectacle to watch. Cool sulphur water springs here are available for pilgrims to take a bath in before they enter the main temple.
                
                Tapkeshwar Temple is one of the most visited temples in the region. While simple and charming in its appearance, it is one of the popular destinations in Dehradun. This destination is also thronged by young travellers as a picnic spot. To reach the temple, one has to take a short trek through the forest.

                A widespread legend is popular about the emergence of the Tapkeshwar Temple. It is said that Ashwathama, the son of Dhronacharya, was born inside the cave. However, his mother did not have enough milk to be able to feed her newborn. Ashwathama was wise beyond his years, and he prayed to Lord Shiva to grant him some milk to satiate his hunger. Being the generous God he is, Lord Shiva granted the wish of the newborn for milk to suffice his hunger. Since then, a Shiva Linga has been established there which is said to grant the wishes of all those who visit this temple seeking the Lord's blessings.


                The Tapkeshwar Temple is a gentle amalgam of manmade and natural design. It is situated between two gentle hills, while the main sanctum is contained within the bounds of a naturally occurring cave. The architecture itself pertains to typical Hindu style and is a humble edifice with a simple and small facade.
