                    With colour changing underlit floors (ladies, maybe don’t wear white!), a bar right in the centre and a swanky alfresco space, it’s got all the ingredients to make for a good time. Our favourite part? The stunning view it offers of Namma Bengaluru. Open from 5:30 PM to 11:30 PM, try their signature cocktails like the Cinnamon Apple Breeze, Irish Comet and Fresh Meteor. 

                    With the DJ spinning banging tunes from EDM tracks to commercial hits, they also take requests, so if you want to get down to Single Ladies, then make sure you tell them. With parties happening every night, call beforehand to know what kind of music is playing. Pair your drinks with munchies on the menu like their Chicken, Bbq Cottage Cheese, Chicken Satay and pasta and you’re sorted. Since it is expensive, we suggest heading here for important occasions like birthdays and anniversaries.
